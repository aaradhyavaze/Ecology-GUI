It is also the only rainforest that we have left in terms of size and diversity. There have been several myths regarding these forests- the most striking one is that of being contributors to 20% of the global oxygen production. But, more conservative and precise estimates that have taken into account consumption of oxygen by species in the forest itself and other related factors suggest that the net contribution toward global oxygen production amounts to only about 6%. Instead, the oxygen we breathe is the legacy of phytoplankton in the ocean that have over billions of years steadily accumulated oxygen that made the atmosphere breathable. It is estimated that marine plants produce between 70 and 80 percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere. Nearly all marine plants are single celled, photosynthetic algae. They play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by forming the energy base of the food web for all aquatic organisms. Also, the larger algae provide a habitat for fish and other invertebrate animals.\n",
